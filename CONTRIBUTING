## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that expects all participants to be respectful, inclusive, and considerate. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [gke@6admin.io](mailto:gke@6admin.io).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vim-plugin-manager.git
   cd vim-plugin-manager
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository** as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/vim-plugin-manager.git
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Ensure you're working on the latest code:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the [coding standards](#coding-standards).

3. Test your changes (see [Testing](#testing)).

4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feature: Add support for XYZ"
   ```
   
   Commit message prefixes to use:
   - `feature:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for test additions or modifications
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `style:` for formatting changes
   - `chore:` for routine tasks and maintenance

5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a [pull request](#pull-request-process).

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the pull request template completely.
2. Link any relevant issues using GitHub keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").
3. Ensure your PR passes all tests and CI checks.
4. Request a review from a maintainer.
5. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary changes.
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style and structure.
- For Vimscript:
  - Use 2-space indentation.
  - Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.
  - Use snake_case for functions and variables.
  - Prefix internal functions with `s:`.
  - Prefix plugin-specific functions with `plugin_manager#`.
  - Document functions with comments.
  - Use Vim script's native idioms.

## Testing

Currently, the project uses manual testing. When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. Verify your changes work correctly in both Vim and Neovim.
2. Test all related functionality to ensure no regressions.
3. Include steps to manually test your changes in the PR description.

Future improvements may include automated tests.

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality.
- Document new features in:
  - The README.md file
  - The plugin's help documentation (doc/plugin_manager.txt)
  - Code comments for functions

Documentation should be clear, concise, and include examples where appropriate.

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, please include:

1. A clear and descriptive title.
2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
3. Expected and actual behavior.
4. Vim/Neovim version and OS information.
5. Relevant error messages or screenshots.
6. Any relevant configuration or setup.

Feature requests should include:
1. A clear description of the problem the feature would solve.
2. Any proposed solutions or implementation details.
